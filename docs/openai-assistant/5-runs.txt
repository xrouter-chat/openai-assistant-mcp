metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

instructions
string or null

Optional
Overrides the instructions of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model

Optional
The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

reasoning_effort
string or null

Optional
Defaults to medium
o-series models only

Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

response_format
"auto" or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Hide possible types
string
auto is the default value

Text
object
Default response format. Used to generate text responses.


Hide properties
type
string

Required
The type of response format being defined. Always text.

JSON object
object
JSON object response format. An older method of generating JSON responses. Using json_schema is recommended for models that support it. Note that the model will not generate JSON without a system or user message instructing it to do so.


Hide properties
type
string

Required
The type of response format being defined. Always json_object.

JSON schema
object
JSON Schema response format. Used to generate structured JSON responses. Learn more about Structured Outputs.

type
string

Required
The type of response format being defined. Always json_schema.

stream
boolean or null

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "file_search"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

Optional
Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Hide properties

Create thread and run
Beta
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/runs
Create a thread and run it in one request.

Request body
assistant_id
string

Required
The ID of the assistant to use to execute this run.

instructions
string or null

Optional
Override the default system message of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

Optional
The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

response_format
"auto" or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Hide possible types
string
auto is the default value

Text
object
Default response format. Used to generate text responses.


Hide properties
type
string

Required
The type of response format being defined. Always text.

Optional
The schema for the response format, described as a JSON Schema object. Learn how to build JSON schemas here.

strict
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to enable strict schema adherence when generating the output. If set to true, the model will always follow the exact schema defined in the schema field. Only a subset of JSON Schema is supported when strict is true. To learn more, read the Structured Outputs guide.

type
string

Required
The type of response format being defined. Always json_schema.
